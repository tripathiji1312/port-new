Projects
Aura — AI-Powered Diabetes Management | Python, Flask, Keras, LSTM, PostgreSQL, NLP | GitHub
2025
• Engineered a hybrid glucose forecasting system combining a personalized, fine-tuned LSTM model with an
event-based adjustment layer, improving prediction accuracy by adapting to individual user data.
• Trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent within a custom physiological simulator to recommend optimal insulin
dosing strategies, achieving a 15% improvement in simulated Time-in-Range.
• Developed a sophisticated NLP engine to accurately extract dietary and activity data from unstructured user logs,
integrating it into a full-stack Flask and PostgreSQL application with real-time dashboards and automated PDF
reporting.
Promptimus - AI Prompt Optimizer | Python, PyTorch, T5, LoRA, RAG | GitHub
October 2025
• Architected an AI prompt optimizer by fine-tuning a 220M parameter T5 model with LoRA and a RAG pipeline to
automatically rewrite user queries for enhanced LLM performance
• Solved the key challenge of preserving user intent by creating a custom dataset of 200,000 examples and
implementing a constrained beam search that used semantic similarity to guide output
• Achieved an average ROUGE-L score of 0.72 against human-written gold standard answers, representing a 28%
improvement over the baseline from un-optimized prompts
LearnBuddy - Adaptive Learning Platform | Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, ML | GitHub
October 2025
• Architected a hybrid adaptive learning engine combining a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) with a heuristic rule
system, analyzing the 12 most recent user attempts to personalize content difficulty.
• Implemented the MAB to manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off, automatically advancing difficulty when
confidence in the current level exceeded 75%.
• Engineered the heuristic layer for rapid adaptation, triggering difficulty increases after 2 consecutive correct answers
(80% success rate) and intervention when success fell below 30%.
Anxiety Level Predictor | Python, scikit-learn, SGDRegressor, Data Analysis | GitHub
April 2025
• Processed lifestyle datasets using advanced encoding techniques and trained SGDRegressor model predicting
anxiety levels on 1-10 scale
• Implemented robust preprocessing pipeline with missing value imputation achieving competitive MAE through
optimization
